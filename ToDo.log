**general**
- update help messages
- when it's all done and ready, check for obsolete functions

- spearate prepare() function, it's driving me crazy as it is.


**create kymograms**
- figure out how to handle tangential images - make eliptical ROIs is fine, I guess, but maybe fitting the ROIs with lines along the long axis would make more sense? Ask user?


**display kymograms**
- add option to display Fourier-filtered kymograms - all three options


**filter kymograms**
- add progress bar


**analyze kymograms**
- continue analysis does not work properly
- define quantification options and incorporated them.
    -> see the analyzeKymograms() function
- add some sort of progress bar or something; as the analysis will take a while (fourier transformations are not very quick even in batch mode)

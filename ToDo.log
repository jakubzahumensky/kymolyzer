'create kymograms'
- fix create_kymograms so that the channels are handled correctly - ask user to select channels?
- figure out a way how to work with ROISets that include SUM/AVG/MEAN in the name - rename or use some wildcard?
	-> ROISet file handling will need to be sorted out, perhaps rename them to correcpond to the original image name, i.e., without -SUM, -MAX, -AVG, -processed, -corr; this requires updating of the other macros as well!!!
- figure out how to handle tangential images - make eliptical ROIs is fine, I guess, but maybe fitting the ROIs with lines along the long axis would make more sense? Ask user?

'display kymograms'
- fix image size handling, so that it does not get too small when run("Tile") is applied mutliple times (it gets smaller each time)

'analyze kymograms'
- define quantification options and incorporated them

general
- update help messages
- initial window LUT selection - used images can have fewer or more than 2 channels; other channels than 1 and 2 might be used for kymogram creation. This needs to be fixed - some older version asked the user what was what

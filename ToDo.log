'create kymograms'
- fix create_kymograms so that the channels are handled correctly
- figure out a way how to work with ROISets that include SUM/AVG/MEAN in the name - rename or use some wildcard?
- figure out how to handle tangential images - make eliptical ROIs is fine, I guess, but maybe fitting the ROIs with lines along the long axis would make more sense? Ask user?

'display kymograms'
- fix image size handling, so that it does not get too small when run("Tile") is applied mutliple times (it gets smaller each time)

'analyze kymopgrams'
- define quantification options and incorporated them

general
- update help messages

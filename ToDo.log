**create kymograms**
- fix create_kymograms so that the channels are handled correctly - ask user to select channels?
- figure out how to handle tangential images - make eliptical ROIs is fine, I guess, but maybe fitting the ROIs with lines along the long axis would make more sense? Ask user?


**display kymograms**



**analyze kymograms**
- define quantification options and incorporated them. 
- when cycling through ROIs to analyze respective kymograms, implement an if statement into analysis - if file exists, open it. Else break cycle or something like that. / if (!endsWith(file, "exclude.tif"))


**general**
- update help messages
- add comments
- initial window LUT selection - used images can have fewer or more than 2 channels; other channels than 1 and 2 might be used for kymogram creation. This needs to be fixed - some older version asked the user what was what - see also 'create_kymograms' section



****ROI_prep and Quantify macros****
I decided on naming ROISets for any type of image with the RAW image name (+ROISet.zip), i.e., excluding suffixes like "-AVG", "-SUM", "-MAX", "-MIN", "-processed", "-corr"). This will need to be implemented in previous macros, and will be considered a major change.

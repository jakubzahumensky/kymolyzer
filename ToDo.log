**general**
- update help messages
- add comments
- when it's all done and ready, check for obsolete functions

- spearate prepare() function, it's driving me crazy as it is.



**create kymograms**
- figure out how to handle tangential images - make eliptical ROIs is fine, I guess, but maybe fitting the ROIs with lines along the long axis would make more sense? Ask user?


**display kymograms**
-


**analyze kymograms**
- define quantification options and incorporated them.
    -> see the analyzeKymograms() function
- add some sort of progress bar or something; as the analysis will take a while (fourier transformations are not very quick even in batch mode)



***ROI_prep and Quantify macros***
I decided on naming ROISets for any type of image with the RAW image name (+ROISet.zip), i.e., excluding suffixes like "-AVG", "-SUM", "-MAX", "-MIN", "-processed", "-corr"). This will need to be implemented in previous macros, and will be considered a major change.

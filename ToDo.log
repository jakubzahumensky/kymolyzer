- fix create_kymograms so that the channels are handled correctly
- define quantification options and incorporated them
- figure out a way how to work with ROISets that include SUM/AVG/MEAN in the name - rename or use some wildcard?
- figure out how to handel tangential images - make eliptical ROIs is fine, I guess, but maybe fitting the ROIs with lines along the long axis would make more sense? Ask user?
